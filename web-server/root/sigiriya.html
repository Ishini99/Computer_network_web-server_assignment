    <p> <strong>Sigiriya or Sinhagiri (Lion Rock Sinhala: සීගිරිය, Tamil: சிகிரியா/சிங்ககிரி, pronounced see-gi-ri-yə)
            is an
            ancient rock fortress located in the northern Matale District near the town of Dambulla in the Central
            Province,
            Sri Lanka. The name refers to a site of historical and archaeological significance that is dominated by a
            massive column of rock around 180 metres (590 ft) high.[2]

            According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the Culavamsa, this area was selected by King Kashyapa (477 –
            495
            AD) for his new capital. He built his palace on the top of this rock and decorated its sides with colourful
            frescoes. On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock he built a gateway in the form of an
            enormous lion. The name of this place is derived from this structure — Sīnhāgiri, the Lion Rock (an
            etymology
            similar to Sinhapura, the Sanskrit name of Singapore, the Lion City).

            The capital and the royal palace were abandoned after the king's death. It was used as a Buddhist monastery
            until the 14th century.[3] Sigiriya today is a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site. It is one of the best
            preserved examples of ancient urban planning.Sigiriya Rock or the Lion Rock is an ancient fort located in
