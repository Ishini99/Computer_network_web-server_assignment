    <p>Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic[a]; commonly known as the ශ්‍රී දළදා මාළිගාව (Glorious Tooth Temple), is a
        Buddhist temple in Kandy, Sri Lanka. It is located in the royal palace complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy,
        which houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. Since ancient times, the relic has played an important role
        in local politics because it is believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country. The
        relic was historically held by Sinhalese kings. The temple of the tooth is a World Heritage Site mainly due to
        the temple and the relic.

        Bhikkhus of the two particular chapters, the Malwathu chapters and Asgiri chapters conduct daily worship in the
        inner chamber of the temple. Rituals are performed three times daily: at dawn, at noon, and in the evenings. On
        Wednesdays, there is a symbolic bathing of the relic with a herbal preparation made from scented water and
        fragrant flowers called Nanumura Mangallaya; this holy water is believed to contain healing powers and is
        distributed to those present.

        The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989, and by Liberation Tigers of
        Tamil Eelam in 1998. However it was fully restored each time.</p>
